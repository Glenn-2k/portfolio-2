# Portfolio 2

![image](/src/assets/pe2.png)

As a developer, you will have to maintain a level of professionalism. This extends past writing code. We need to document our apps so that other developers can run the code without any issues. We also need to keep a professional-looking portfolio so that others have confidence in us and the work that we do.

## Description

We were tasked with creating a portfolio website documenting three of our prior submissions from this last year at Noroff.
